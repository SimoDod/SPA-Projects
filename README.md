# SPA-Projects
SPA Projects with pageJS for routing and lit-html for templating.

In every folder  you will find a local server specified for the current SPA.
You can run it with NodeJS trough terminal/cmd 
Open the server folder with terminal/cmd and type: node server.js;
Now our SPA is making the correct CRUD operations :)
